Meal time is a full stack clone of Yelp and right now it is live! Although it isn't fully completed yet, I have created the major functionalities of what a Yelp clone should have. As of right now, I have the functionalities of User's Auth, rendering all Businesses and showing a specific business that is seeded in the database, and also the ability of creating, editing, and deleting reviews. 

Check it out here! [_Meal time_](https://meal-time-jason.herokuapp.com/#/). 

Feel free to try out the mentioned features with the handy dandy Demo User Login.
